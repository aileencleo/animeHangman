# animeHangman
a web-based anime hangman using vanilla JS

Hello Jeff,
 Thank you. It has been a great learning experience. 
 Here are the areas I has hoping to improve but could not think of how to do it. If you have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.
1. How I created the letters in the keyboard section?
2. How to generate the items that user has to guess?

Best,
Aileen Gatdula
